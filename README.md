# 👋 About Me
Welcome to my GitHub Profile!

## 👨‍💻 Manjinder Singh
I am a passionate **Data Engineer** with a strong background in designing, building, and maintaining scalable data pipelines and architectures. My expertise spans across cloud services, real-time and batch data processing, data modeling, and automation.

While working on any project, I follow a **production-ready mindset** and structure my workflow into three key phases:

### 🔹 Design & Development Phase
- Analyze business requirements.
- Design efficient data models.
- Build robust ETL pipelines to handle large-scale structured and semi-structured data.

### 🔹 Automation & CI/CD Phase
- Package solutions with CI/CD pipelines using **GitHub Actions**, **Docker**, and **Terraform**.
- Ensure seamless deployment and scalability.

### 🔹 Deployment & Monitoring Phase
- Deploy solutions to cloud environments (**AWS**,**Azure**, **Snowflake**, **Databricks**).
- Integrate monitoring to ensure system stability, data quality, and reliability.
